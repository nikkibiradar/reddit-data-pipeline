False,False,What is it like to be a Data Engineer Freelancer?,False,27,"Hi everyone,

After 8 years working in the data engineering industry for big corporates and small-medium size companies, I've decided to become a freelancer.

I've been actively seeking new opportunities since January of this year, and figured out that, compared to 2020-2021, now hiring processes are ridicolously long, time-consuming and tedious that you end up being rejected after spending 2 months of take home assessments, abstract leetcode questions, and technical meetings.

Do you have any experience as a freelancer in the data engineering field? How is it? Would like to receive some feedback, thanks!

False,False,Whata is Data Pipeline Optimization,False,3,"I am new to the data engineering field. To get started I did some end to end projects where I created data pipeline using ADF to upload data to Azure from on-premise database, transformed the data using databricks, analyzed it using Synapse Analytics and finally vizualize it using Power BI.

Now I read some blogs about data engineering and I keep on seeing this term frequently 'Pipeline Optimization' but didn't really understand what it is and how to do it.

False,False,How to create a fast instant spend insight dashboard,False,13,"I live in canada and using td bank. Recently they created an app that gives you spend insights. You spend something it immediately appears in the dash board alongside your other spending for the day. Working with redshift and mysql, i dont think they are capable of providing you with these information almost instantly! I know redshift is pretty powerful database for analytics, heavy joins and group bys, but it cant be this fast. What do they use as database and how is it structured?! Is it cassandra, elastic search or some other db that i am not aware?

Appreciate a bit of details in your answers.

I wrote a pretty gnarly means of assimilating the data using dbt itself, but I’m not really proud of the extended setup and confusing configuration for it to work. Had to use some unintuitive hacking of the dbt mechanics for it to work.

False,False,Doubt on DBT Semantic Layer usage ,False,5,"Hey folks, was thinking of using the DBT as a metric engine. Was going through documentation and have read up on the setup of the different yaml files. Had a query though. If I wanted to drive the final metric creation, but didn’t want to keep it static, how would I do it. What I mean is, let’s say I want to create the metric total sales, and have setup the dimensions as brand and geography. But depending on need, want to either generate for both brand and geography, or only for brand, how do I do this? 
Would this be in the final model sql where I would pass the granularity in the sql, and if yes, could I get an example on this. 
Thanks a lot.",3,Tinjar12,2024-07-14 16:53:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1e371zm/doubt_on_dbt_semantic_layer_usage/,False,1e371zm,0
False,False,Former Data Analyst / MI Manager made Data Engineering Manager.,False,11,"So I've worked for a company for 10+ years. Its a great company and we had on prem SSIS packages working and been effectively SME for our data for a number of years as a senior data analyst. We had a change and they got some actuaries in to do analytics and created an engineering function within IT. I was asked to be in Engineering as I enjoyed understanding systems and building models. We have a third party vendor who was instructed to build a new platform on a  greenfield site with effectively no guidance but told to not use anything we had (no idea why). The architect unsurprisingly has left. What we have will work but isn't great. I am goodt at SQL and know some Python and can do basic SSIS packages. I need to effectively manage this new enterprise data platform but not sure where to start?!

I am obviously doing DP-203 and done data fundamentals which means I can understand their pipelines build in synapse and their basic ways of working but theres no documentation.

My first idea is to enforce vendor to build up their documentation but other than ETL Framework and Security I'm not sure what else is acceptable to request.

I have no one in my team at moment but two Fixed Term Employees coming in to build effectively on top of what we have (the vendor will still be available but I want things more inhouse and use them as a stretch resource - i also only want to build when we have sufficent artifacts from BA's and Analytics requirements). I want to ensure we have good guard rails to ensure stuff built going forward is in a way I would expect but also be challenging if im going wrong direction.

What sort of things should I be looking? First I want to build out for specific use cases and not applications. We have several data applications models going from source to curated (every table!)  but nothing built around specific topics or functions I. e an underwriting and claims data mart instead of 5 separate applications models linked by bridge tables (some are done using start schemas and others done by SCD as well).

I also need to ensure given its cloud I have thought about security and not sure where to begin? Up until now we've had an open data culture.

Not sure how I ended up in this position, its a great opportunity but incredibly stressful and overwhelming. Any help would be great? Management seem more keen on me ensuring documentation and frameworks than doing coding but I'd quite like to do both if possible.

Apologies for grammar, wording as this is a bit of a brain dump im typing on phone as I fail dp-203 practice exam

Thanks
